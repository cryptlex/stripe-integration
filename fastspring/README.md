# @cryptlex/fastspring-integration
A lightweight server application designed to handle `order.completed`, `subscription.charge.completed`, `subscription.payment.overdue` and `subscription.deactivated` events from Fastspring. Upon receiving these webhooks, the server will automatically create, renew,
suspend and delete licenses in Cryptlex, ensuring a seamless integration between Fastspring payments and Cryptlex licenses.

## Requirements
To run this application, you must set the following environment variables in your hosting environment:

- **FASTSPRING_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: Your Fastspring secret, used to verify the authenticity of incoming Fastspring events.
- **CRYPTLEX_WEB_API_BASE_URL**: The base URL of the Cryptlex Web API.
- **CRYPTLEX_ACCESS_TOKEN**: A valid Cryptlex API access token with the `license:read`, `license:write`, `user:read`, `user:write` permissions; used to authenticate requests to the Cryptlex API.

## Installation & Usage
This project provides two preconfigured deployment targets based on your runtime environment:
- **AWS**: For running the server on AWS Lambda using GitHub Actions.
- **Node**: For running the server in a Node.js environment, including containerized deployments.

### AWS Lambda
